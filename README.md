### About the Project
## Inspiration
We were inspired by the common challenge people face when seeking quick, reliable health information. The internet is full of articles, but it can be difficult to discern credible sources from misinformation. We wanted to create a tool that provides a first point of contact for health-related queries, offering well-researched and concise answers in a user-friendly format. The goal was to build a personal health companion that's always available, empowering users with knowledge to make more informed decisions about their well-being.

## What it does
HealthMitra is an AI-powered health assistant that provides instant, accessible information on a wide range of health topics. Users can sign up and ask questions about symptoms, general health concerns, and simple remedies. The application processes the query and generates a detailed, easy-to-understand response, acting as a conversational partner. It's a convenient, non-judgmental way to get quick answers to common health questions, all within a secure and private platform.

## Technologies Used
The project was built using a robust tech stack to ensure a smooth and responsive experience. The frontend was developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating a modern and intuitive user interface. For the backend, we utilized Firebase for user authentication and data management. This allowed us to handle user sign-ups and logins securely. The core of the application's intelligence is powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically a gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20 model, which is responsible for processing user queries and generating relevant health information.

## Challenges Faced
One of the primary challenges we faced was ensuring the accuracy and safety of the information provided by the AI. Since health is a sensitive topic, it was crucial to implement a system that filters out potentially harmful advice and emphasizes that the app is not a substitute for professional medical consultation. We also faced challenges in optimizing the app's performance to provide near-instantaneous responses, which required careful management of API calls and data handling. Finally, designing a simple and accessible user interface that still felt professional and trustworthy was an iterative process that required a lot of trial and error.

## What's next for HealthMitra
For the future of HealthMitra, we plan to expand its functionality. This includes adding a feature for users to save and track their health queries. We would also like to integrate more specific medical databases to provide more specialized information and potentially include a feature for local doctor and clinic searches. Our ultimate goal is to evolve HealthMita into a comprehensive health management tool that goes beyond simple Q&A.
